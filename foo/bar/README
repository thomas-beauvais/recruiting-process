Red Hat Recruiting Process Project 
__________________________

Just using this repo as a spot to host all projects associated with the Red Hat Consulting Recruiting Process.

As you can see, each user can have a folder at the root level.  Eventually, when we get to having a code base that is operated on by all users we
will want a 'trunk' folder at the same level.

This isn't actually branched or anything so we can't use those features but they aren't really necessary for this small of a project.
